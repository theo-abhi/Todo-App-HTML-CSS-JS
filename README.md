# Todo-App-HTML-CSS-JS

A simple and efficient **To-Do List** application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This app helps users manage daily tasks by adding, marking, and deleting them with ease—entirely on the client-side.

## ✅ Features

- **Add Tasks:** Enter and add new to-do items quickly.
- **Mark as Completed:** Click on a task to mark it as done.
- **Delete Tasks:** Remove tasks when they’re no longer needed.
- **Persistent Storage (Optional):** Tasks can be saved using `localStorage` to retain them across sessions.
- **Responsive UI:** Works well on desktop and mobile devices.
- **Minimal, Clean Design:** Focused on user-friendly interaction.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5** – App structure and layout
- **CSS3** – Styling and responsive design
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – App logic and interactivity (including localStorage)
